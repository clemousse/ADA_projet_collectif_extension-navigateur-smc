# Chrome extension

Here is our project of extension for Chrome, realized with Sandrine Le Diraison at Ada Tech School, between 2022.09.05 and 2022.09.15.

The extension allows you to see the events in Paris for the current month, selected by categories.

We used theses tools :
- API "Que Faire Ã  Paris", 
- the Chrome Developers API,
- JavaSCript,
- HTML/CSS
